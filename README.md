# AI-ML-Biomarkers

## A slightly long story on how I came about starting an independent research project. During this poor job market situation, I had applied to so many positions (and counting), but to no avail. I have faith in myself to get something for the summer, but I realised that while applying for jobs and networking, I also realised I have to work hard on honing my AI/ML skills. Luckily I am taking an Applied ML class and I thought about reaching out to my professor.

## I reached out to my professr about a possible opening in his lab, but he gave me a better idea to work on an individual project about a topic I am interested in. I have read a lot on biomarkers and I thought that this would be really interesting, and here we are!

## Under the guidance of Dr. Alhassan Yasin, I decided to take on this project. To start off, I found a paper looking at atrial fibrillation biomarkers, and they walked through the process of that. I thought replicating this would be a good idea to familiarise myself to R, limma and differential expression gene analysis (DEG). This repo will have various code I am working on, some will be incomplete but would be on the repo since I would like you to see my progress
